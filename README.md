# npc-personal-directory
This project was created in order to practice skills with for tying up front-end interface and data with a back-end server built with Express.js framework. 

# Scenario
You want to create an online catalog of your favourite NPC's from all the games that you like to play, the initial front-end interface is completed and you already have some data stored in a JSON document. You have decided to create a web server for compleating this application called NPC Personal Directory. This site’s data will be stored on the server you create. This will allow other gamers to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.

# Tools Used

* Express.js
* Insomnia - to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser.
* Heroku - to deploy a server.js file that will run the Node.js process. You’ll also use the Heroku CLILinks to an external site., which will help you deploy apps easily without leaving the command line.``
